# Hyperledger Fabric Client (HFC) SDK for Node.js 

The Hyperledger Fabric Client (HFC) SDK for Node.js provides a powerful and easy to use API to interact with a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. The HFC is designed to be used in the Node.js JavaScript runtime.

#### See the following for development environment choices

* [Self Contained Node.js Environment](node-sdk-self-contained.md) uses prebuilt docker images for the Node.js Client SDK application interacting with Hyperledger Fabric block chain. This environment may be all that is required for most Node.js application developers. The environment has a built in standalone sample ready to go.
